## Why ?
Starting new projects with Event Sourcing architecture usually require some time to bootstrap all the components and is often done by copy/paste of existing projects with all the drawbacks we know.   

To avoid this, Imerologio CLI let's you bootstrap a fully configured Event Sourcing application with languages/technologies/components that fit the best for you. The generated application comes with all Kubernetes resources and infrastructure scripts needed to deploy it.
